      <h1 class="w3-text-teal">South Africa</h1>
      <p>My most fond memory of travel was when I went to South Africa with my family in 2011. I was 12 years old but I remember it as if it was yesterday. We first landed in Cape Town where we spent a couple of days discovering the city and enjoying ourselves by visiting tourist attractions including Table Top Mountain and Robin Island. We then moved closer to Kruger National Park for the next week where we had two safari's every day. I remember being amazed at the beautiful wildlife and also the friendly people in the park. A particular memory that stands out is when we saw a cheetah hunting an impala(breed of wild dear). The reason it was so memorable was because after a few close calls the impala got away and everyone on the safari cheered with joy. </p>

      <h1 class="w3-text-teal">Thailand</h1>
      <p>Another memorable family holiday was when we went to Thailand in 2014. Once again we went to a major city before going somewhere more remote, firstly stopping off in Bangkok before moving on to Krabi in the south. Once again after visiting the tourist attractions in the city such as the beautiful monastery's and pearl Budhest statues. We also experienced the chaotic night markets of the city as a result of our baggage getting lost in the airport. We then went to Krabi for more of a relaxed mood aided by the snorkeling and sun-bathing, with the exception having to put up with a tropical storm one night.</p>

    <div class="w3-twothird w3-container">
      <h1 class="w3-text-teal">Granada(Caribbean)</h1>
      <p>My most recent family holiday was to the Caribbean and more specifically to the Island of Granada. The reason for this unusual destination is because an old friend of my parents now lives on the island and had been asking them to visit for years. As you can imagine the Caribbean is a more relaxed destination than the usual family holiday. it mainly consisted of chilling out at the pool and visiting nice restaurants in the town in the evening. Even though it did not have as many stand out moments as the other holidays it will still live long in the memory.  </p>
